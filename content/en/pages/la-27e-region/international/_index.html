    <p>  <br>The 27th Region operates within a rich and diverse landscape of European and international actors involved in public and social transformation. In 2018, we wrote an article for Horizon Publics magazine that sought to highlight the geopolitics of these actors, their motivations, and their vision of innovation  ( Here ). We participate in various more or less formal communities, which allow us to share approaches, inspire each other, and build alliances: for example, the  States of Change  network, which brings together public innovators from Europe (including Nesta, Kennisland, Demos, etc.), America (including Public Policy Lab NYC, Mars Solution Lab, etc.), and beyond, with the aim of sharing and improving our practices. Nesta, Kennisland, Demos, etc.), America (including Public Policy Lab NYC, Mars Solution Lab, etc.) and beyond, with the aim of sharing and improving our practices, and  SIX- Social innovation Exchange , which pursues similar objectives in the field of social innovation. We also collaborate occasionally with the European Commission and the UNDP ( United Nations Development Programme ).  We have also built partnerships and projects with a European or international dimension that enable us to explore certain topics or areas of work in greater depth and share inspiration:   <br>  <br> With the Bloomberg Foundation , around the emergence of public innovation labs, which allows to cross the work carried out in Transfo  with the programme  Innovation teams ;  <br> Several EU funded programmes (Erasmus +) allowed us to explore emerging topics in European territories :   Enacting the commons , with 6 other French partners, to explore how the commons transform public action in Europe through a series of study visits to 8 European territories and communities; Environmental Justice, with a group of 5 partners to explore how to reconnect transition and social justice issues :  <br> Two partnerships also allow us to deepen the question of the new competences of public officials:  European College of Cluny , on the one hand, around an introduction module to public policy design for European public officials;  with several Serbian and European universities and administrations  a project funded by the European Union to develop training programmes for Serbian public officials. </p>  <p> Our recent activities in the international sphere  </p>
