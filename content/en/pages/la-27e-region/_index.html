    <p>La 27e Région ?  <br>   <br>We are The 27e Région, a nonprofit organisation gathering local governments as well as other public stakeholders. Our permanent team has about ten people with various profiles: sociology, design, management, political science, cultural policies, etc. Our vision : in order to face ecological, social and democratic challenges, we must invent a new model of society, capable of reducing social inequalities while taking care of natural resources and other living beings. We are accompanying the transformation of public policies in this direction. We help public actors to connect to reality, to question in depth the aims they pursue, and to transform their way of designing and implementing public policies.</p>  <p> Disseminating an experimental culture  <br>   <br>With our community of members, practitioners and researchers, we have been developing for almost twenty years a culture of public action based on experimentation and on the possibility of trying and making mistakes to learn and progress. We are designing and implementing tests to explore the future of public services.

Our members participate through companionship activities, participatory investigations, and multi-annual research, training and action programs.</p>  <p> Some of the things we are good at  <br>   <br>Building capacity within public administrations.

We always ensure that the international dimension is taken into account to provide inspiration and perspective.   Articulating research and action.  We have learned to mobilize groups of stakeholders that combine various disciplines and articulate research and action in order to address increasingly complex issues and produce operational knowledge.
