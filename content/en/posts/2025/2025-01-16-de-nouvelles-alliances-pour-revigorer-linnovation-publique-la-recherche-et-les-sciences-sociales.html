        <p><em>This rostrum is published in the "Large Ideas" section of the new journal<a href="https://www.ellyx.fr/inspirations/interlignes/">Interline</a>, published in January 2025 by the social R&D cooperative Ellyx.</em></p><p>Research - particularly in the social sciences - is not doing very well, even though we have never needed it so much. SHS researchers are right to denounce the lack of vision and public policy to meet the challenges of the moment. As the period of new budgetary shortages is not a good omen, it may be necessary to explore other avenues - for example, on the side of decentralising research.</p><p>What if research was seen as not only an institution, but also as a culture to be shared, a set of investigative and experimental practices, various ways of producing knowledge, multiple and constantly evolving uses? Such decentralization might give us the prospect of new alliances.</p><p>First, it should be noted that the activities and uses of research in the social sciences and humanities have expanded considerably to include non-researchers. As we know at least since the<a href="https://www.librairie-gallimard.com/livre/9782130451761-logique-la-theorie-de-l-enquete-john-dewey/#:~:text=%C3%80%20propos,pragmatisme%2C%20est%20paru%20en%201938."><em>survey theory</em></a>Research activity is not restricted to researchers. In his 1938 book, philosopher John Dewey invites us to consider the emancipatory nature of the activity of investigation and experimentation for everyone - as much for individuals as for collectives and institutions. It is a set of activities that help to liberate and re-tool the one who practices it, especially if it is directly concerned with the problem being studied.</p><p>A concern that today drives many citizens and actors of the general interest towards hybrid forms of research, in which researchers and non-researchers work hand in hand to try to solve social problems: groups of inhabitants, social entrepreneurs, cooperatives, non-profit associations, multidisciplinary collectives, living labs, third-places, NGOs, artists, designers...</p><p>In response to this growing appetite for citizen forms of research, communities and administrations have not remained inactive. A few dozen communities and administrations have already shown the way,<a href="https://1000doctorants.hesam.eu/">by welcoming researchers and doctoral students</a>, by entering into agreements with research laboratories, by providing them with investigative grounds. But this approach has limitations of a systemic nature.</p><p>Perhaps it is time to be more intentional and more precise in the obstacles that should be removed. What if communities are organized to become more involved in this type of activity? Why would elected officials and directors-general, when launching administrative plans or planning exercises, not use them to program action research or social R&D activities? Why would the investigative skills not be part of the Public Officials' jobsheet?</p><p>Why not change the hundreds of<a href="https://www.modernisation.gouv.fr/campus-de-la-transformation-publique/laboratoires-innovation">public innovation laboratories</a>created in recent years by the state and local authorities towards ambitious areas of action research or public and social R&D? Is this not a good subject for cooperation between communities, administrations, collective citizens, economic actors? Would this not be a way out of the endless calls for projects, for c<a href="https://www.la27eregion.fr/innovation-par-mission-mission-impossible/">oalize actors around ambitious "missions"</a>on a territorial or sector-wide basis?</p><p>When looking at research as a set of practices, it is less about waiting for changes from the top than about finely identifying the "pressure points" on which to act to change the system, and creating new alliances. Let us continue to list the adjustments to be made and the obstacles to be overcome, and let us bet that the combined action of civil society actors, universities, communities and pioneering administrations will help create the long-awaited momentum!</p>
